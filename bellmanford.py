        Find the shortest paths (sum of edge weights) from start_vertex to

        relaxations resulting in an improvement greater than tolerance are
        considered. For negative cycle detection, if the sum of weights is
        greater than -tolerance it is not reported as a negative cycle. This
        is useful when circuits are expected to be close to zero.
